Hello,

Thanks for making it to my ReadMe file. This is the first ReadMe file that I have ever written. Truthfully, it is the first ReadME file
that I have ever OPENED. So, I have a rough idea of what should go in here from what I found on the internet.

The contents in this file are:

1) presentation - the pdf version of my powerpoint presentation on Kings County Housing Prices
2) student.ipynb - the data analysis performed for Module 1.

Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks!
